## **What problem this solves**

### __Problem__: 

Some movie reviews applications like  Rotten Tomatoes are filled with biased and paid reviews by movie producers who only have interest with specific types of movie reviews. 

### __Solution__:

Our team decided to create this desktop GUI application so that we don’t have to look at inaccurate movie reviews when looking for good movies to watch.

## **Why we built this project**

We wanted to build this project to create a desktop GUI application that will allow the user to create, read, update, and delete movie reviews. We also wanted our application to have honest reviews without biased and paid reviews by movie producers.

## **Our motivations**

Our motivation for this project is that we want to create an honest desktop application that will help other user’s to find a good movie to watch.
